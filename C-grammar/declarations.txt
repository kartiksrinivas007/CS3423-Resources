declaration -> 
declaration_spec, list of initialized declarators

specs are basically lists of storage class spec and type_specifiers (they contain TYPE_NAME (i.e it could also be an identifier) ( probably for structs this is useful) and also type qualifiers like CONST and VOLATILE

init_declarator -> bunch of (declarators or declarators = initializers)

declarator = pointer ( direct_declarator ) or direct_declarator

like
a[1][1] or a ( int m , int l ) etc , like function declarations as well

initializer_list == {bunch of assignment_expressions separated by commas}

Abstract declarators , pointers and type_name:-
