Recursive descent is top-down and is left to right
E - > T | T + E
T -> int | int*T | (E)

Recursive descent writes down a matching procedure which returns true ( either if the terminal mathches the content of the next pointer or if a certain part o fthe input string can be generated by a subtree rooted at the non-terminal.

bool E(){
token save = *next;
return E_1(next = save) || E_2(next = save)
}
