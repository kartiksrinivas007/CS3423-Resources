First(X) = {t | X => ta} U {Eps | X => Eps}

First(term)  = term
eps belong to First(T) 
and T => A_1A_2...A_n, if eps belongs to first of A_i for all i then eps belongs to First(T)

First(alpha) is a subset of First(X) if X => A_1A_2...A_n(alpha) and all A_i are nullable

E => TX 
T => (E) | int Y 
X => +E | eps
Y => *T | eps

X -> nullable
Y -> nullable
first(X) = {*, eps}
first(Y)  ={* , eps}
first(T) = {( , int}
Since T is not nullable, it follows that first(E) is a superset of first(T) in this case they are actually equal since T is not nullable.
