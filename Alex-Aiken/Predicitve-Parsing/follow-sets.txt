Follow(X) = {t | S =>+ beta X t delta}

Intuition 
X => AB then First(B) belongs to Follow(A)
"" , Follow(X) is a subset of follow(B), Xt -> ABt
"", Follow(X) is a subset of follow(A) is B is nullable!

$ is in the follow of S 

Algorithm:
$ in Follow(S)

consider A-> alpha X beta

First(beta) - {epsilon} is  a subset of Follow(X)
Follow(A) is a superset of Follow(beta) and also Follow(X)(provided beta is nullable)
E => TX 
T => (E) | int Y
X => +E | eps
Y => *T | eps

Follow(E) = {$,),....}
Follow(X) is a subset of Follow (E) ( by 3 ) 
Follow(E) is a subset of follow(X) (by 1)
so both must be equal 
Follow(X) = Follow(E)
Follow(E) = {$,), ....}
Follow(T) = must have First(X) and Follow(T) is a superset of Follow(E) ( because of X nullability) 
Follow(T) is also a superset of Follow(Y)
Follow(Y) is also a superset of Follow(T)
so follow(T) = follow(Y)
Follow(T) = {+,$,)} = Follow(Y)
Follow(() = {First(E)}
Follow()) = Follow(T) = { +, $, )}
Follow(*) = First(T) + ( T not nullable)
Follow(int) = First(y) + FOllow(T)  = {*,+, $, )}
