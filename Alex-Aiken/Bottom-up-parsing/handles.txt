E -> T + E
T -> int * T | int | (E)

classic expression grammar

Then take the string int | * int + int
T -> int could be reduced ... but this may not be then reducible to the start symbol after applying the steps,
basically a reduction that can get a string that is derivable from S 
S ->* alpha X w -> alpha Beta w 
so iff alpha Beta is one the stack then beta can be reduced to X 
i.e some sequences of reductions can still lead to the start symbol

the handle is the full RHS of the derivation of what you are doing 

Thm : At shift reduce parsing  a handle will occur only appear at the top of thestack

Induction on # reduce moves

Initially 0 moves, epsilon 
immediately post reduction we move to the right of the non terminal
next handle must exist to the right of the non terminal or at the non terminal itself ( because it is a rightmost derivation)
