Why nabla
1. What is nabla?
Language Specifications:-
2. Primitive data-types - int float...etc
3. Arrays-(Tensors) - array indexing/dereferencing
4. Functions available for tensors:- pow, add, mult, sub, elementwise, convolution(maybe),cosine, sine, exp(), log()
4. Control flow
	5. for-loops
	6. if statement
7. Modes-Normal, Autodiff
8. Do we give the possiblisity of functions 
9. no #define's and typedefs
10. NO pointers
Autodiff is one feature we want to build, explain the process and then talk about the control flow, etc : 
Compiler-Plan
1. Transform to LLVM-IR
2. Write code for matrix multiplication ourselves
3. Combine the IR's and feed it into LLVM
