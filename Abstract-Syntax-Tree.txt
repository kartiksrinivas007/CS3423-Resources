The abstract syntax tree is a simplified version of the parse tree that 
removes redundant nodes ( eg  nodes with only a single child are replaced with only the child).
say T -> ( E + E ) and E -> int 
It focuses more on the operation, since the parse tree alread has parsed the input in the correct order( BODMAS - wise). So the AST gets rid of the brackets and makes something like this :-

plus (5, -> plus(3, 2))
